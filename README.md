# Ping-Pong-App
React Native Project that allows users to play a game of ping pong on their phone

## Skills Used
* React Native
  * TouchableOpacity
  * Views
  * Hiding the Status Bar
* React Native Game Engine
* Flex styling

## Playing the Game
The game is genuinely fun to play, especially in study hall and AP Computer Science. <br/>
My CS teacher, however, doesn't think that the game is very fun and says that I have rigged the bot to always beat him (he's just bad).

## Improvements
This game was a great project but I may add some improvements to the UI and gameplay. <br/>
I think that it could certainly use better button styles and some icons. It could also include a leaderboard that uses an external API

## To play on your own device 
1. Clone this repo
2. cd into project folder (cd ./Ping-Pong-App/)
3. Run the command: expo install
4. Run the command: expo start
5. Get the Expo Go app on android or iOS
6. Scan the QR code and enjoy the game

## Conclusion
It was overall a surprisingly fun project. It started off with a rocky start because I had to learn react-native-game-engine and there aren't many great resources out there.
But by the end, I had at least the basics down. The game itself was also enjoyable and was a nice way to procrastinate in my CS class.
